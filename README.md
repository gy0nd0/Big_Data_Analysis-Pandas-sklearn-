Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of data preprocessing practices for big data analytics using pandas and scikit-learn.
It focuses on the end-to-end process of preparing raw data for analysis and machine learning — from cleaning and interpolation to encoding and text preprocessing.
Each notebook demonstrates how to transform complex, messy datasets into structured, meaningful data ready for modeling.

Key Features
	•	Data Cleaning & Handling: Missing values, outliers, and type conversions
	•	Interpolation: Various strategies to estimate and fill missing data points
	•	Binning: Discretization of continuous variables into categorical intervals
	•	Encoding: Label and One-Hot encoding for categorical data
	•	Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization for NLP tasks
	•	Integration with scikit-learn Pipelines: Practical preprocessing workflows for ML

Tech Stack
	•	Language: Python 3
	•	Core Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib
	•	Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Purpose

This project aims to build a solid foundation for working with real-world data by mastering the preprocessing techniques essential for modern data science and machine learning.
It is well-suited for students, researchers, and developers who want to gain hands-on experience with pandas and scikit-learn in data-driven workflows.
